# ethereum-reputation-system
On-chain reputation system for wallets, txs, tokens, and nfts, contracts and more. 

It's possible to build a decentralized reputation system that's similar to the ones used by platforms like Amazon or eBay. The system could allow users to upvote or downvote other users based on their interactions, and could include preset reactions or comments to provide more context.

So far reputation systems are based on L2s and now zksyncs, but it could be as easy as a gasless tx on mainnet, if you ensure the user signs the right thing. Limiting each wallet to only one signature per address or contract would help prevent spam and ensure a more accurate rep system.

In terms of UI/UX design, suggesting wallets, transactions, contracts, and tokens based on the user's previous interactions could help streamline the feedback process and increase user engagement. This could be achieved by analyzing the user's transaction history and identifying recent interactions with other wallets or contracts.

For example, if a user recently sent a transaction to a new contract, the interface could suggest rating the contract and providing feedback on its performance or functionality. Similarly, if a user recently received a transaction from a new wallet, the interface could suggest rating the wallet and providing feedback on the sender's trustworthiness or reliability.

By using these suggestions and making it easy for users to provide feedback on recent interactions, the interface could help build a more robust and accurate reputation system for Ethereum wallets and contracts.

Obviously a  reputation  system could be  beneficial for the broader Ethereum network but my idea was centered around applications in physical commerce involving NFTs. Although several platforms have attempted to solve the issue of redeeming physical NFTs, none have provided a sustainable and decentralized solution. The problem lies in the lack of trust in a second-hand physical NFT transfer that represents a physical asset. To address this, a reputation system can be established to ensure that the new buyer of an NFT representing a physical asset can trust the condition and transfer of the asset.

The code is very basic and test-level, created with chatGPT4 and brain. ðŸ¤–ðŸ§
